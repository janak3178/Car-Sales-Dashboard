# Project Title:
Car Sales Dashboard Analysis Using Power BI (2019–2022)

Problem Statement:
Automobile companies handle large volumes of data related to sales, service, budget, and growth. However, stakeholders often lack a centralized and visual way to analyze this data effectively over time. This leads to delayed decision-making and missed opportunities in sales forecasting and service planning. The challenge is to present this complex data in a clear, interactive, and actionable format for strategic decision-making.

Objectives:
To create an interactive and real-time dashboard for car sales performance analysis.

To visualize key metrics such as:

Total Sales (746K)

Growth (21.4%)

Pre-Sales (614K)

Budget (473K)

To analyze sales types (Third-party, Direct, Pre-booking).

To observe monthly trends and identify peak months.

To compare replacement, servicing, and other sales segments.

Challenges:
Data Integration: Combining various types of sales and budget data into a unified format.

User Interface: Maintaining clarity and readability while keeping the visuals engaging.

Filtering Performance: Allowing year-wise filtering (2019–2022) without performance lag.

Categorization Complexity: Accurately categorizing data into types (servicing, replacement, etc.) and sale types.

Real-time Update Setup: Automating data refresh while maintaining report consistency.

Future Scope:
Predictive Analysis: Add forecasting models using machine learning to predict next quarter sales.

Customer Analysis: Integrate customer feedback or satisfaction data.

Geographic Analysis: Add region-wise sales trends using map visuals.

Service Optimization: Link service data to after-sales support and parts management.

Mobile Compatibility: Optimize for mobile/tablet usage for sales teams on the go.

Live Data Integration: Connect to live databases or APIs for real-time updates.

Conclusion:
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive and visually appealing overview of car sales performance. It simplifies complex data into meaningful visuals that help identify trends, measure growth, and compare sales types. With enhancements like predictive analytics and live data integration, this tool can evolve into a strategic asset for automotive sales and service analysis
